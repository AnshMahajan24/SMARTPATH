## About
SmartPathPlanner converts full addresses into geographic coordinates (via OpenRouteService), builds a fully-connected distance graph using real-world driving distances, and computes optimized routes using fast TSP heuristics. Built for prototyping, teaching, and small-scale route planning.

---

## Key Features
- Geocode full addresses to latitude/longitude (OpenRouteService).  
- Build a real-world distance matrix (ORS routing).  
- Generate optimized routes. 
- Streamlit UI for quick input, visualization, and export.  
- Export results as CSV and map snapshots.

---

## Tech Stack
- **App:** Streamlit  
- **APIs:** OpenRouteService (geocoding & routing)  
- **Language:** Python 3.10+
